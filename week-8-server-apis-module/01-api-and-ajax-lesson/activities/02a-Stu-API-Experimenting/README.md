## Instructions:

Using the [RapidAPI library](https://rapidapi.com/) as a starting point, experiment with a few APIs of your own.

**Notes:**
* You will need to create an account on RapidAPI first.

* Use the "free" filter, as some APIs require a subscription. (The filter can be found on the advanced search page. Navigate there by typing anything into the search box and hitting enter).

* Not all the APIs are easy to useâ€”just keep experimenting!
