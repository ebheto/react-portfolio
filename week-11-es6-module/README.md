# Module 11 Instructor Overview: ES6

## Overview

In this module, you'll introduce students to Node.js and the concepts of standard libraries, modules, and npm. The majority of the module will be focused on the new syntax that came with ES6 JavaScript, from arrow functions to object destructuring and more.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* If students ask why they are learning Node.js, explain that Node.js allows us to run JavaScript outside of the browser and allows us to access things like the file system.

> This is as far as we want to go with Node.js for this class. We will only be utilizing Node.js and NPM for the modules and outside of the browser functionality in order to set up React.

* Ensure that students have already installed Node.js on their computers before coming to class.

  * Direct students to the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

## Heads-Up

Next week, we begin OOP (object-oriented programming), constructors, and classes. With that in mind, it's important to get students comfortable with ES6 and other Node.js fundamentals this week to prepare them for more abstract concepts.
